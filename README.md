This repository contains dotfiles plus some scripts to set up my environment on a new Mac. This builds on an older repo containing my emacs configuration and takes inspiration from https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles

# Set up
1. Clone the repository somewhere
2. Run `brew.sh` and `brew-cask.sh` to install some required packages
3. Run `symlink-setup.sh` to symlink the dot-files to your home folder
